# week-9-compose-files
This repository is for my copy of the week 9 Docker Compose assignment.  It is based on the Docker Compose tutorial (https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/), but implements the Redis caching as persistent storage.

## Instructions
Be sure that you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.  For installation instructions, see https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download.  After that, you can run the following command:

`docker-compose up`
