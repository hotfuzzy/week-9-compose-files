# week-9-compose-files
This repository is for my copy of the week 9 Docker Compose assignment.  It uses Docker Compose to create a LAMP setup with a PHP web page that pulls from the MySQL database.

## Instructions
Be sure that you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.  For installation instructions, see https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download.  After that, you can run the following command:

`docker-compose build`
`docker-compose up`
